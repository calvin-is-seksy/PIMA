## Inspiration ## 

Can we train a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not a patient in the dataset has diabetes or not. Mary is a pre-med student at UCSB while Calvin is a CS student pursuing deep learning. We will be attempting to combine our interests to tackle a Kaggle challenge. 

## Data ## 

We acquired our data from Kaggle.
