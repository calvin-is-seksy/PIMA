# PIMA Indian Diabetes Diagnosis #

## Inspiration ## 

Can we train a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not a patient in the dataset has diabetes or not. Mary is a pre-med student at UCSB while Calvin is a CS student pursuing deep learning. We will be attempting to combine our interests to tackle a Kaggle challenge. 

## Data ## 

We acquired our data from Kaggle.

## Exploratory Analysis ## 

## Training ## 

## Results ## 

- 1st round training: We chose to ignore all instances in the dataset with missing values in this round. After training for 40 epochs and a batch size of 5, our model performs at 69.6% accuracy for diabetes diagnosis.
